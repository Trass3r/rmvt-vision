%SHOWCORNERS	Overlay corner features on image
%
%	[X,Y] = SHOWCORNERS(C, n, spacing)
%	F = SHOWCORNERS(C, n, spacing)
%	SHOWCORNERS(C, n, spacing)
%	SHOWCORNERS(C, n, spacing, marker)
%	SHOWCORNERS(C, n, spacing, marker, labelsize)
%
%	Returns the coordinates of the N strongest corners in the corner
%	structure C.
%	The second form overlays a blue square at the location of the N 
%	strongest corners.  
%	The third form allows the marker shape/color to be specified using
%	a standard plot() type string, eg. 'sb', or 'xw'
%	Fourth form additionally labels the features in the specified font.
