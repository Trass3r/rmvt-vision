%SCALESPACE  Return scale-space image sequence
%
%   [G,L,scale] = scalespace(im, n);
%   [G,L,scale] = scalespace(im, n, sigma);
%
% where im is the input image, n the length of the scale space sequence, and sigma
% is the width of the Gaussian.  At each scale step the variance of the Gaussian
% increases by sigma^2.  The first step in the sequence is the original image.
%
% L is the absolute value of the Laplacian of the scale sequence, G is the scale sequence,
% and scale is the vector of scales used at each step of the sequence.
