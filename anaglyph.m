%ANAGLYPH Convert stereo images to an anaglyph image
%
%   ag = anaglyph(left, right, disp)
%   ag = anaglyph(stereopair, disp)
%
%  The left and right images are given separately or as a 3D image
%  where the last index is 1 for left, and 2 for right.
%
%  The default color encoding is left=red, right=cyan, but can
%  be changed with a trailing option (default is 'rc').
%
%   ag = anaglyph(left, right, colors)
%   ag = anaglyph(stereopair, colors)
%
%  colors is a string wth 2 letters, the first for left, the second 
%  for right, and each is one of:
%    r   red
%    g   green
%    b   green
%    c   cyan
%    m   magenta
%
%   ag = anaglyph(left, right, colors, disp)
%   ag = anaglyph(stereopair, colors, disp)
%
% disp allows for disparity correction, if positive the disparity is increased, if negative it
% is reduced.  This is achieved by trimming the images.  Use this option to make the images more
% natural/comfortable to view, useful if the images were achieved with a non-human stereo baseline
% or field of view.
