%STEREO Stereo matching
%
%   [disp,sim] = stereo(L, R, w, range)
%   [disp,sim] = stereo(L, R, w, range, metric)
%   
% Where L and R are the left- and right-images of a stereo pair, of either
% double or uint8 class.
%
% w is the size of the matching window, which can we a scalar for wxw or a
% 2-vector [wx wy] for a wx x wy window.
%
% range is the disparity search range, which can be a scalar for disparities in
% the range 0 to range, or a 2-vector [dmin dmax] for searches in the range
% dmin to dmax.
%
% metric is a string that specififies the similarity metric to use and can be
% one of 'zncc' (default), 'ncc', 'ssd' or 'sad'.
%
% disp and sim are both images of the same size as L and R.
% The value of disp(i,j) is the disparity for pixel L(i,j).
% The value of sim(i,j) is the similarity score corresponding to the disparity.
%
% For both output images the pixels within a half-window dimension of the edges 
% will not be valid and are set to NaN.
%
%   [disp,sim] = stereo(L, R, w, range, metric, interp)
%
% if interp is non-zero then the disparity imaage, disp, will be interpolated
% to fraction pixels.
