%EDGELIST Return list of edge pixels for region
%
%   e = edgelist(im, seed)
%
%  Return the list of edge pixels as a matrix, each row is one edge
% point (x,y).  im is a binary image where 0 is assumed to be background,
% non-zero is an object.  seed is a starting point on the edge of the
% blob to be traced.  The seed point is always the first element of
% the edgelist.
%
%   e = edgelist(im, seed, direction)
%
%  Choose the direction of edge following.  direction == 0 (default) means
% clockwise, non zero is counter-clockwise.  Note that direction is with
% respect to y-axis upward.
