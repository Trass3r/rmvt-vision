%ILAPLACE	Convolve with Laplacian kernel
%
%	im2 = ilaplace(image)
%
%	Return the image after convolution with the Laplacian kernel
%		0 -1  0
%		-1 4 -1
%		0 -1  0
%
%  The returned image is the same size as the original image and pixels that
% result from the convolution mask exceeding the image bounds are set to zero.
