%KDOG	Difference of Gaussian kernel
%
%	k = kdog(sigma1)
%	k = kdog(sigma1, w)
%	k = kdog(sigma1, sigma2, w)
%
%	Returns a difference of Gaussian kernel which can be used for
%	edge detection.
%	The Gaussians have standard deviation of sigma1 and sigma2 
%	respectively, and the convolution kernel has a half size of w, 
%	that is, k is (2W+1) x (2W+1).
%
%	If w is not specified it defaults to 2*sigma.
